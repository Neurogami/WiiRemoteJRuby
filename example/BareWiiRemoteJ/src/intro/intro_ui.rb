# Your View class will almost certainly need a Java Swing class to show to the user.
#
# To understand how Monkeybars views work, see:
#
#     http://wwww.monkeybars.org/understanding-views
#
# Each View class has a class method, 'set_java_class', to which you pass
# the Swing class to use for the actual GUI.
#
# It accepts either a string or a class constant. 
# If you pass a string, the View class will look for a compiled Java file of that name  
# and use that:
#
#    set_java_class 'basic.ExampleFrame'
#    # assumes you are providing the Java Swing class ExampleFrame.class, in the package 'basic'
#    # and that it is on the $LOAD_PATH
#
# If passed a class constant, the View class assumes it already exists and uses it.
#
#    set_java_class ExampleFrame
#    # assumes you are have defined the Ruby class ExampleFrame and that it
#    # embodies a usable Swing class.
#
# If you are creating a complex application you would do best to use a WYSIWYG Swing editor
#  (such as provided for free in Netbeans) and compiling the resulting code to a .class file.
#
#  However, if you prefer to define your UI using Ruby you can do so by creating a class
#  that inherits, for example, from  javax::swing.JPanel
#
#  The generated code presented here defines some simple Ruby classes to wrap a few Swing components.
#  It is meant to give some idea on how this can be done; it is by no means a complete  Ruby/Swing UI tool.
#
#  Note that you don't have to place this code in the same file as your Monkeybars View class,
#  but it needs to be processed before your view code sets its Java class.
